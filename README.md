# Referee delegation system
System for delegating referees to volleyball matches
## Objectives of the project
Create a web application that allows:
- Manage matches, referees and teams across seasons and competitions.
- Manually (possible extension: automated) delegate suitable referees to matches based on refereeâ€™s license, availability, location and rating. 
- Allow referees to enter their availability and track their matches.
- Send email (possible extension:sms) notifications to referees about assigned matches.
